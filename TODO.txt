[config]
use a selectable dropdown or separate window for category filter

[BUG]
income transactions count towards the Categorize limit even if they are then discarded
	ex. limit=10, use_internal=False -> 8 expenses, 2 income -> returns only 8 items
	might also happen for category filtering?

[BUG]
CategorizerView shows the split poorly

[general]
make a workflow that allows changing the data source
	next step will be creating future transactions after parsing/categorizing but before display

[Predicting]
have ways to compare predicted vs actual
	ex. "this transaction was predicted to be X, but is actually Y"
	ex. "predicted final balance was X, updated prediction is Y"
	primary use case: I made plans and decisions based on a prediction, want to know if those plans need to change
	secondary use case: sanity-check if the prediction system works

[Categorizing]
Allow deleting records via template:
	delete - special "DELETE" category (better than just empty "new" because less error-prone)
	I made logic for this, but haven't tested it

[CategorizerView]
Be able to sort columns
Also columns should have a header
	make header separate from the scrollable canvas, that way it stays at the top
	PROBLEM: then header won't have horizontal scrolling

[BucketTimeline]
Make a "slush fund" bucket. Income categories add to it, expense categories take from it
	replaces the hard-coded monthly additions

[CategorizerView]
Allow typing with autocomplete for category

[Categorizing]
Some system for creating generic templates
	will probably need to figure out how to put it in the right nested group

[MView]
Option for hiding categories with no transactions

[Categorizing]
There should probably be a section for "overrides" at the top of the templates to manually override generic templates
For now just give auto-gens a separate file that overrides generics
FIXME need to check what the order of precedence actually is

[Categorizing]
Some way to remove duplicate templates

[Categorizing]
Some way to validate all templates

[General]
Probably a way to load the JSON schema enum to create Constants.categories

[CategorizerView]
Make Category font match other cells (should also help with sizing)
	unless OBE

[CategorizerView]
Remove the separation between rows (how long has that been there?)

[CategorizerView]
Right now mouse wheel only scrolls when pointing at the scroll bar. Enable it for the whole window

[TransactionTimeline]
Color-code based on broad category, then either use color variation or markers to identify precise category

[TransactionTimeline]
Use matplotlip picker event handler thing to allow interrogating points (ex. what was this transaction?)

[BucketTimeline]
Hard-code initial value for each bucket

[MView]
summary sheet:
	add monthly super-category timeline
	add category average bar chart
	add income/expenses/internal tables

[MView]
tracker sheets:
	separate based on super-category

[MView]
general:
	make all sheets available, either through tabs or a main menu

[General]
Make something that looks like MView but groups things by account rather than category
	Idea is to see how money moves between accounts
	Can also be used for checksumming against current balance

[Categorizing]
Make a module to convert from the old system (with categorizations and descriptions) to the new one
	This is better than doing it manually, or making something temporary
	Actually... this should probably be lower priority
	Just start fresh from some date, and ignore the old stuff for now
