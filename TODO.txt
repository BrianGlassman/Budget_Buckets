Probably a way to load the JSON schema enum to create Constants.categories

CategorizerView:
	Be able to sort columns
	Also columns should have a header
		make header separate from the scrollable canvas, that way it stays at the top
		PROBLEM: then header won't have horizontal scrolling

	Make Category font match other cells (should also help with sizing)
		unless OBE

	Remove the separation between rows (how long has that been there?)

	Allow typing with autocomplete for category

	Right now mouse wheel only scrolls when pointing at the scroll bar. Enable it for the whole window

TransactionTimeline:
	Color-code based on broad category, then either use color variation or markers to identify precise category

	Use matplotlip picker event handler thing to allow interrogating points (ex. what was this transaction?)

BucketTimeline:
	Hard-code initial value for each bucket

	Make a "slush fund" bucket. Income categories add to it, expense categories take from it

Categorizing:
	Some system for creating generic templates
		will probably need to figure out how to put it in the right nested group

	There should probably be a section for "overrides" at the top of the templates to manually override generic templates

	Some way to remove duplicate templates

	Some way to validate all templates

	Make a module to convert from the old system (with categorizations and descriptions) to the new one
		This is better than doing it manually, or making something temporary
		Actually... this should probably be lower priority
		Just start fresh from some date, and ignore the old stuff for now
