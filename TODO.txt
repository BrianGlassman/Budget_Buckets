Update to the new USAA format and descriptions

Make the Transactions JSON multi-layer nestable

Make Category font match other cells (should also help with sizing)
	unless OBE

Remove the separation between rows (how long has that been there?)

Some system for creating generic templates

There should probably be a section for "overrides" at the top of the templates to manually override generic templates

Some way to remove duplicate templates

Some way to validate all templates

Allow typing with autocomplete for category

Right now mouse wheel only scrolls when pointing at the scroll bar. Enable it for the whole window

Make a module to convert from the old system (with categorizations and descriptions) to the new one
	This is better than doing it manually, or making something temporary
	Actually... this should probably be lower priority
	Just start fresh from some date, and ignore the old stuff for now
