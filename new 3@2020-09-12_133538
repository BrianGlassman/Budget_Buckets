want a way to keep my real data and settings separate from "fake" ones
	this way I don't upload my real info to the internet at large
	
worktrees - not really sure what these are or how they work yet
separate branches, setting push.default = matching MIGHT keep the private one from being pushed (or the default git setting might work, idk)
separate files/folders, use gitignore to avoid pushing the real stuff and have some non-VC way to switch between them


IDEA:
	all of my data is in a directory
	the local ignore file ignores this directory
	directory is itself a repo, for tracking changes to the data
	maybe use git submodules, which are pointers to a repo (not subtrees, which are copies)
